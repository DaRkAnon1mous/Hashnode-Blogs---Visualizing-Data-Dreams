### Introduction

If youâ€™ve looked at Python scripts, you might have come across this line:

But what does it really mean? This blog demystifies this construct and explains its importance in distinguishing between script and module usage in Python.

### The Role of `__name__`

In Python, every module has a built-in attribute called `__name__`. When a module is run directly, `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`. However, if the module is imported, `__name__` is set to the moduleâ€™s name.

### Why Use `if __name__ == '__main__':`?

This construct allows you to:

* **Run Code Only When a Script is Executed Directly:**

* **Prevent Code from Running on Import:** This is particularly useful if your script contains test code or standalone execution logic that shouldnâ€™t run when the module is imported elsewhere.
    

### Practical Example

Letâ€™s say you have a script called [`calculator.py`](http://calculator.py) with a `main()` function that performs calculations. By wrapping the call to `main()` in an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, the script will only perform calculations when run directly, not when imported as a module.
