**📌 Overview:** Asynchronous programming allows for efficient multitasking by letting programs handle tasks without blocking the execution of other tasks. In this blog, we’ll explore how `async` and `await` work in Python to improve performance in I/O-bound tasks.

**🔍 Key Points:**

* What is asynchronous programming? ⏳
    
* Using `async` and `await` in Python 🛠️
    
* An example of an asynchronous HTTP request using `aiohttp`
    

**💻 Example Code:**
